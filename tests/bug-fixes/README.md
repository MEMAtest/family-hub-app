# Bug Fix Verification Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test scripts to verify that critical bug fixes are working correctly in the Family Hub application.

## Test Suites

### 1. Calendar Event Update Fix (`calendar-event-update.test.ts`)

**Bug Fixed:** Calendar event update was returning 500 errors when dragging/dropping events or editing event details.

**Root Cause:** The PUT endpoint was receiving UI field names (`date`, `time`, `person`, `type`, `duration`, `recurring`) but Prisma expected different field names (`eventDate`, `eventTime`, `personId`, `eventType`, `durationMinutes`, `recurringPattern`).

**Fix Applied:** Updated `/src/app/api/families/[familyId]/events/route.ts` PUT handler to properly map UI fields to Prisma schema fields.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Event update with UI field names doesn't return 500 error
- ✅ Response correctly transforms back to UI format
- ✅ Database fields are correctly mapped from UI fields
- ✅ Drag & drop scenario works correctly

**Run:** `npm run test:bugfix:calendar`

---

### 2. Budget Modals Family Members Fix (`budget-modals-family-members.test.ts`)

**Bug Fixed:** Budget entry forms (income/expense modals) were showing hardcoded family members instead of actual family members from the database.

**Root Cause:** The modals had hardcoded family member arrays for testing purposes.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `AddExpenseModal.tsx` to use `useFamilyStore` to get real family members
- Updated `AddIncomeModal.tsx` to use `useFamilyStore` to get real family members
- Added "Family (All Members)" option to both dropdowns

**Tests:**
- ✅ Both modals import `useFamilyStore`
- ✅ Both modals retrieve `familyMembers` from store
- ✅ Both modals have "Family (All Members)" option
- ✅ Both modals correctly map family members to dropdown options
- ✅ No hardcoded family members remain
- ✅ Actual family members exist in database

**Run:** `npm run test:bugfix:budget`

---

### 3. Chart Visual Fix (`chart-visual-fix.test.ts`)

**Bug Fixed:** The expense breakdown pie chart had labels cut off and needed better spacing.

**Root Cause:** The chart height was too small (350px) and had no margins, causing labels to be cut off.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `CategorySpendingChart.tsx`:
- Increased chart height from 350px to 400px
- Added margins to PieChart (top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20)
- Changed section title to "Expenses Category Summary" for clarity

**Tests:**
- ✅ Chart height set to 400px
- ✅ Chart has complete margins (top, right, bottom, left)
- ✅ Title changed to "Expenses Category Summary"
- ✅ ResponsiveContainer properly configured
- ✅ Chart structure complete (PieChart, Pie, Tooltip, Legend)
- ✅ Custom label renderer present

**Run:** `npm run test:bugfix:chart`

## Running Tests

### Run All Bug Fix Tests
```bash
npm run test:bugfixes
```

This runs all three test suites and provides a comprehensive summary.

### Run Individual Test Suites

Calendar Event Update Test:
```bash
npm run test:bugfix:calendar
```

Budget Modals Test:
```bash
npm run test:bugfix:budget
```

Chart Visual Fix Test:
```bash
npm run test:bugfix:chart
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables

The tests use the following configuration:

- **Database URL:** Uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable or defaults to the Neon database
- **Family ID:** Tests use family ID `cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g`
- **API Base URL:** Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or defaults to `http://localhost:3000`

### Prerequisites

1. **Database Access:** Tests require access to the PostgreSQL database with valid test data
2. **Family Data:** The test family must have at least one family member
3. **Running Application:** For API tests, the Next.js application should be running locally

## Test Results

Each test suite provides:

- ✅ **Pass/Fail Status** for each test
- 📊 **Detailed Messages** explaining what was verified
- 🔍 **Error Details** when tests fail
- 📈 **Success Rate** percentage
- ⏱️ **Duration** of test execution

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure bug fixes remain stable:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Bug Fix Tests
  run: npm run test:bugfixes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test Fails: "No family members found"

**Solution:** Ensure the test family (ID: `cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g`) has family members in the database.

### Test Fails: "Connection refused"

**Solution:** Make sure the Next.js dev server is running (`npm run dev`) before running API tests.

### Test Fails: "Database connection error"

**Solution:** Verify the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly and the database is accessible.
