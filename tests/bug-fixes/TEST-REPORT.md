## Test Suite 1: Calendar Event Update Fix

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Duration:** 1.38s
**Tests Run:** 3
**Tests Passed:** 3
**Success Rate:** 100.0%

### Bug Description
Calendar event updates were returning 500 errors when users tried to drag/drop events or edit event details in the calendar interface.

### Root Cause
The PUT endpoint at `/api/families/[familyId]/events/route.ts` was receiving UI field names (`date`, `time`, `person`, `type`, `duration`, `recurring`) but Prisma expected different field names (`eventDate`, `eventTime`, `personId`, `eventType`, `durationMinutes`, `recurringPattern`).

### Fix Applied
Updated the PUT handler to properly map UI fields to Prisma schema fields:
```typescript
// Map UI fields to Prisma columns
const updateData: any = {};
if (date) updateData.eventDate = new Date(date);
if (time) updateData.eventTime = eventTime;
if (person) updateData.personId = person;
if (type) updateData.eventType = type;
if (duration) updateData.durationMinutes = duration;
if (recurring) updateData.recurringPattern = recurring;
```

### Test Results

#### Test 1.1: Event Update with UI Fields
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Verified:** Event can be updated using UI field names without 500 error
- **Details:** Successfully updated event with date, time, person, type, duration, and recurring fields

#### Test 1.2: Database Field Mapping
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Verified:** Database fields correctly mapped from UI fields
- **Details:**
  - eventDate correctly stored: 2025-11-20
  - eventTime correctly stored: 15:30
  - eventType correctly stored: appointment
  - durationMinutes correctly stored: 90
  - recurringPattern correctly stored: weekly
  - isRecurring correctly set: true

#### Test 1.3: Drag & Drop Update
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Verified:** Drag & drop scenario works correctly
- **Details:** Event successfully moved to new date (2025-11-12) and time (14:00)

### Impact
Users can now successfully:
- ✅ Drag and drop events to new dates/times
- ✅ Edit event details without encountering errors
- ✅ Update recurring event patterns
- ✅ Change event assignments to different family members

## Test Suite 2: Budget Modals Family Members Fix

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Duration:** 0.56s
**Tests Run:** 11
**Tests Passed:** 11
**Success Rate:** 100.0%

### Bug Description
Budget entry forms (AddExpenseModal and AddIncomeModal) were showing hardcoded family members instead of actual family members from the database.

### Root Cause
The modals had hardcoded family member arrays that were used for initial development/testing but were never replaced with real data from the store.

### Fix Applied
Updated both modals to use `useFamilyStore` to get real family members:
```typescript
// Get family members from store
const familyMembers = useFamilyStore((state) => state.familyMembers);
```

Added "Family (All Members)" option to both dropdowns:
```typescript
<option value="all">Family (All Members)</option>
```

### Test Results

## Test Suite 3: Chart Visual Fix

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Duration:** 0.24s
**Tests Run:** 6
**Tests Passed:** 6
**Success Rate:** 100.0%

### Bug Description
The expense breakdown pie chart in the Budget dashboard had labels cut off at the edges and needed better spacing for improved readability.

### Root Cause
The chart height was set to 350px which was too small, and the PieChart component had no margins, causing labels to be clipped at the edges.

### Fix Applied
Updated `CategorySpendingChart.tsx`:
1. Increased chart height from 350px to 400px
2. Added margins to PieChart: `margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}`
3. Changed title to "Expenses Category Summary" for better clarity

### Test Results
