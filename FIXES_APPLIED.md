# Fixes Applied - Calendar & Budget Issues

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED - REQUIRES CACHE RESET**

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. Calendar Not Showing Stewart Fleming Dates ❌
- **Problem:** Calendar only showed 2 old events, not the 29 events in database
- **Root Cause:** Zustand persist middleware was caching old data from localStorage
- **Database Status:** ✅ All 29 events ARE in Neon DB (verified)
  - 17 Stewart Fleming (Pioneer Academy) events for Amari
  - 12 Swimming lesson events for Askia

### 2. Budget Not Persisting Across Pages ❌
- **Problem:** Budget data lost when navigating between pages
- **Root Cause:** Zustand was caching old budget data, not loading from API
- **API Status:** ✅ Budget API works correctly

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Disabled Zustand Cache for Dynamic Data
**File:** `src/store/familyStore.ts` (lines 370-381)

**Changed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE - cached everything
partialize: (state) => ({
  people: state.people,
  events: state.events,
  budgetData: state.budgetData,
  // ...
})

// AFTER - excluded dynamic data
partialize: (state) => ({
  // DO NOT persist - load fresh from database
  // people: state.people,
  // events: state.events,
  // budgetData: state.budgetData,
  // ...
})
```

**Why:** Events, people, and budget must load fresh from the database every time, not from cached data.

### Fix #2: Direct API Loading in useDatabaseSync
**File:** `src/hooks/useDatabaseSync.ts` (lines 12-68)

**Changed:**
- Now fetches directly from `/api/families/[id]/events` and `/api/families/[id]/members`
- Updates Zustand store with fresh data
- Added console logging to track loading
- Bypasses localStorage intermediate step

**Why:** Ensures data loads from API, not stale cache.

### Fix #3: Budget Dashboard Auto-Update
**File:** `src/components/budget/BudgetDashboard.tsx`

**Changed:**
- Loads income/expenses from API on mount
- Recalculates totals when data changes
- Fixed useEffect dependency array warning

**Why:** Budget totals now reflect actual API data, not hardcoded mock values.

## How to Apply Fixes

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Must Clear Cache

The fixes are in place, but your browser has cached the old data. **You MUST clear cache** for the fixes to work.

### Option 1: Use Reset Tool (Recommended)
1. Open: **http://localhost:3001/reset-app.html**
2. Click **"Clear All Cache"**
3. Click **"Load from Database"**
   - Should show: "✅ 29 calendar events"
   - Should show: "✅ 4 family members"
4. Click **"Go to App"**
5. Verify calendar shows all events

### Option 2: Manual Browser Reset
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **"Clear site data"**
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## Verification Checklist

After clearing cache, verify:

### Calendar (http://localhost:3001 → Calendar)
- [ ] See 29 total events (not 2)
- [ ] October 2025 shows swimming lessons (Sundays)
- [ ] See INSET days, term starts/ends for Amari
- [ ] Analytics shows: "Total Events: 29" (not 2)
- [ ] Events persist after page refresh

### Budget (http://localhost:3001 → Budget)
- [ ] Income matches what you added (not hardcoded £8,445)
- [ ] Expenses match what you added (not hardcoded £6,100)
- [ ] Totals auto-update when you add income/expense
- [ ] Navigate to Calendar and back - budget data persists

## Current Database State

**Verified via API:**
```
GET /api/families/cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g/events
✅ Returns 29 events
   - 17 for Amari (Stewart Fleming dates)
   - 12 for Askia (Swimming lessons)

GET /api/families/cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g/members
✅ Returns 4 members
   - Ade (Parent)
   - Angela (Parent)
   - Amari (Teen Student)
   - Askia (Child Student)

GET /api/families/cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g/budget/income
✅ Returns current income items

GET /api/families/cmg741w2h0000ljcb3f6fo19g/budget/expenses
✅ Returns current expense items
```

## Why This Happened

**Root Cause:** Zustand's `persist` middleware

The app uses Zustand with persistence, which saves state to localStorage. This is great for offline support, but it was caching:
- Old calendar events (only 2 events from before Stewart Fleming dates were added)
- Old family members (Test User instead of Ade, Angela, Amari, Askia)
- Old budget data (hardcoded mock values)

Even after adding 29 events to the database, the UI kept showing the cached 2 events because Zustand loaded from localStorage before the API sync completed.

**Solution:** Exclude dynamic data (events, people, budget) from persistence so it ALWAYS loads fresh from the database.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Clear your cache** using one of the methods above
2. **Verify all 29 events appear** in the calendar
3. **Verify budget persists** when navigating pages
4. **If issues persist**, check browser console for error messages and provide them

## Support Files for Testing

Run these anytime to verify database state:

```bash
# Check all events in database
npx tsx check-all-events.ts

# Test all API endpoints
npx tsx test-all-apis.ts

# Add family members again (if needed)
npx tsx add-family-members.ts

# Add swimming lessons again (if needed)
npx tsx add-swimming-lessons.ts

# Add school dates again (if needed)
npx tsx add-stewart-fleming-dates.ts
```

**Status:** All fixes applied. Waiting for cache reset to take effect.
