# AI Features Fixes - Complete Summary

## Status: ✅ BOTH FEATURES FIXED AND TESTED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Budget AI Insights - Income/Expense Totals Mismatch ✅

**Problem**: AI insights showed £32,850 income instead of the actual £9,112 shown in the dashboard.

**Root Causes**:
1. Database had duplicate recurring income entries (4x "Monthly Salary" from different months)
2. Query was fetching ALL salary entries without proper deduplication
3. Query excluded items with `null` recurringStartDate (e.g., the £112 "test" income)
4. Deduplication logic was ordering by `recurringStartDate` instead of `createdAt`

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Changed query ordering from `recurringStartDate: 'desc'` to `createdAt: 'desc'` (lines 62-67, 106-108 in `/src/app/api/ai/budget/insights/route.ts`)
2. Added support for items with null `recurringStartDate` using nested OR conditions (lines 50-53, 92-95)
3. Updated deduplication logic to keep FIRST occurrence by `createdAt` (matches dashboard behavior)
4. Applied same logic to both income and expenses

**Test Results**:
```
Total Income: £9,112 ✓ (matches dashboard exactly)
Total Expenses: £7,607.25 ✓ (correctly deduplicated)
AI now generates insights based on actual database data
```

### 2. Receipt Scanner - Database Save Error ✅

**Problem**: Receipt scanner failed with `PrismaClientValidationError` when trying to save scanned expenses to database.

**Root Cause**:
Frontend was sending `name` field but database schema expects `expenseName` (line 60 in `/prisma/schema.prisma`).

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `ReceiptScanner.tsx` (lines 137-144) to explicitly map extracted data fields:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
body: JSON.stringify({
  ...extractedData,
  isRecurring: false
}),

// After (CORRECT):
body: JSON.stringify({
  expenseName: extractedData.name,  // Map 'name' to 'expenseName'
  amount: extractedData.amount,
  category: extractedData.category,
  paymentDate: extractedData.paymentDate,
  isRecurring: false,
  personId: null
}),
```

**Test Results**:
```
✓ Expense saved successfully
  ID: cmgk3c7vl0001ljs0am1rfto8
  Name: Test Receipt Scanner
  Amount: £25.5
  Category: Food & Dining
```

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/ai/budget/insights/route.ts`
   - Lines 40-68: Updated income query with null handling and createdAt ordering
   - Lines 85-109: Updated expenses query with same logic

2. `/src/components/budget/ReceiptScanner.tsx`
   - Lines 128-159: Fixed field mapping in `handleSaveExpense` function

## Test Scripts Created

1. `test-deduplication-fix.ts` - Tests budget insights with actual database data
2. `test-receipt-save.ts` - Tests receipt scanner save functionality
3. `debug-budget-data.ts` - Diagnostic script for budget queries

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Test budget insights
DATABASE_URL="your-db-url" ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key" npx tsx test-deduplication-fix.ts

# Test receipt scanner save
DATABASE_URL="your-db-url" npx tsx test-receipt-save.ts
```

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

## AI Model Used

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **SDK**: @anthropic-ai/sdk v0.39.0
- **Features**:
  - Budget insights: Text generation with spending analysis
  - Receipt scanner: Vision API with document content type for PDFs and images

## Production Deployment

The app is ready for deployment with these fixes. To deploy:

1. Ensure environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

2. Push changes to main branch - Vercel will auto-deploy

3. Test both features in production:
   - Budget page → "Get AI Insights" button (should show correct totals)
   - Budget page → "Scan Receipt" button (should save scanned expenses)

## Next Steps

Both AI features are now working correctly and have been thoroughly tested. The user can:

1. ✅ View accurate budget insights based on their actual income/expenses
2. ✅ Scan receipts and save them to the database without errors
3. ✅ See AI-generated recommendations based on real data

No further action required - both features are production-ready.
