# AI Features Implementation Summary - FINAL (Claude Sonnet 4)

## ✅ Successfully Implemented & Tested

### 1. Receipt Scanner with PDF Support ✅

**Problem Solved:**
- Original implementation used OpenRouter/Qwen2-VL which had PDF incompatibility issues
- User requested PDF support for receipt scanning
- User provided Claude Sonnet API key and requested switching to Anthropic

**Solution Implemented:**
- Switched to **Claude Sonnet 4** (model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) via Anthropic SDK
- Native support for BOTH images AND PDFs through Anthropic's vision API
- PDFs use `document` content type, images use `image` content type

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/app/api/ai/receipt/scan/route.ts`
   - Complete rewrite to use `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
   - Uses `document` content type for PDFs (lines 72-81)
   - Uses `image` content type for images (lines 83-92)
   - Enhanced JSON extraction with regex fallback
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. `src/components/budget/ReceiptScanner.tsx`
   - Re-enabled PDF file validation
   - Updated file input to accept PDFs
   - Updated UI text to show "Upload Image or PDF"

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Receipt Scanner API - Response Status (200 OK)
✓ Receipt Scanner - Has expense object
✓ Receipt Scanner - Has name
✓ Receipt Scanner - Has amount
✓ Receipt Scanner - Has category
✓ Receipt Scanner - Has date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
✓ Receipt Scanner - Valid category
```

**Success Rate: 100% (7/7 tests passed)**
**Response Time: 2-3 seconds**
**Status: FULLY WORKING ✅**

### 2. Budget Insights - Data-Focused Analysis ✅

**Problems Fixed:**
- AI was giving GENERIC advice instead of using actual data
- Response said "High-Spending Categories: Housing, Food, Transportation" even though user had different categories
- User wanted: "Your family received £X income and spent £Y, leaving £Z surplus"
- AI was ignoring the data and asking for more information
- User provided Claude Sonnet API key for better instruction-following

**Solution Implemented:**

**Major Changes:**
1. Switched to **Claude Sonnet 4** (model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) via Anthropic SDK
   - Much better at following structured prompts than Qwen/Gemma
   - Faster response time (3-4 seconds vs 11 seconds)
   - More consistent output format

2. Implemented **Few-Shot Prompting** with concrete example
   - Showed AI exact format expected
   - Provided example input and output
   - Made instructions crystal clear

3. **Pre-processed data in code** before sending to AI
   - Sorted expense categories by amount
   - Calculated net surplus/deficit
   - Identified top 2 categories automatically

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/services/aiService.ts` (lines 8-88)
   - Complete rewrite to use Anthropic SDK
   - Changed AI model to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
   - Implemented `chat()` method using `anthropic.messages.create()`
   - Enhanced budget insights prompt with few-shot examples
   - Pre-sort categories and calculate net in code

2. `src/components/budget/AIInsightsCard.tsx` (lines 134-156)
   - Added smart text parsing to remove markdown
   - Implemented bullet point rendering
   - Added section header styling

**Test Results:**
```
AI Response:
"Your family received £32,850.00 income and spent £23,656.25, leaving £9,193.75 surplus.
Your biggest expenses were Groceries (£8,500.00) and Transport (£6,200.00).
Consider meal planning and bulk buying to reduce grocery costs by 10-15% (saving £850-1,275/month),
and review transport options like carpooling, public transport, or combining trips to potentially
save £500-800/month."

✓ Starts with actual figures
✓ Mentions total expenses
✓ Mentions net remaining
✓ Mentions top expense category (Groceries) with amount
✓ Mentions second expense category (Transport) with amount
✓ Does NOT contain generic advice
✓ Provides specific savings suggestions
```

**Success Rate: 100% (6/6 required checks passed)**
**Response Time: 3-4 seconds**
**Status: FULLY WORKING ✅**

  system: systemPrompt,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'document',
          source: {
            type: 'base64',
            media_type: 'application/pdf',
            data: imageData,
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: userPrompt
        }
      ],
    },
  ],
});

// For images - use 'image' content type
const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  system: systemPrompt,

          source: {
            type: 'base64',
            media_type: 'image/jpeg', // or 'image/png'
            data: imageData,
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: userPrompt
        }
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Production Readiness

**Environment Requirements:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Works on Vercel serverless functions

   - Scanned receipts work better than photographed ones
   - Low-resolution PDFs may have reduced accuracy

4. **Expense Categories**
   - Limited to predefined categories
   - User can manually adjust after extraction
   - Categories: Food & Dining, Groceries, Shopping, Transport, Entertainment, Utilities, Healthcare, Education, Other

4. Add receipt image preview in UI
5. Store receipt images for audit trail
6. Implement OCR fallback with Tesseract.js for offline support
7. Add user feedback mechanism to improve extraction accuracy

### Performance Optimizations:

```

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Receipt Scanner Returns 500:**
- Check OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set
- Verify image/PDF is valid base64
- Check OpenRouter API status

**Budget Insights Shows Wrong Data:**
- Verify family ID is correct
- Check budget data exists in database
- Review month/year parameters

**PDF Upload Fails:**
- Ensure file is valid PDF (not corrupted)
- Check file size (should be under 10MB)
- Try converting PDF to image first

### Debug Mode:
Server logs show detailed request/response data including:
- Image data length
- API response status
- Extracted expense details
- Error messages

## New: Budget Forecasting & Benchmarking (October 2025)

### What’s New
- **Forecast API (`POST /api/ai/budget/forecast`)** – aggregates the last 3-12 months of Prisma-backed expenses, expands recurring items across the requested window, folds in upcoming calendar events with costs, and calls `aiService.predictSpendingTrend` for a natural-language summary. Returns structured projection data for charts plus trend statistics.
- **Benchmark API (`POST /api/ai/budget/benchmark`)** – compares live category spend against a curated UK household dataset (`src/data/ukBudgetBenchmarks.ts`) and wraps `aiService.compareToAverages` for AI commentary. Produces per-category deviations and overall metadata.

### Front-end Enhancements
- `AIInsightsCard.tsx` now offers **two tabs**: “Spending insights” (existing AI summary) and a new “UK benchmarks” comparison with refresh controls, loading states, and category variance badges.
- `ExpenseForecast.tsx` rebuilt to consume live forecast data, render combined historical/predicted charts, surface AI narrative snippets, and highlight upcoming cost drivers pulled from calendar events.
- Added responsive controls for forecast horizon selection (3/6/12 months) and refreshed mobile-friendly layout.

### Supporting Utilities & Tests
- Introduced `src/utils/budgetAnalytics.ts` for reusable aggregation logic (monthly summaries, forecast context, category totals).
- Added Jest coverage in `src/utils/__tests__/budgetAnalytics.test.ts` to lock in behaviour for recurring vs one-off expenses and trend detection.

### Data & Telemetry Safeguards
- All prompts continue to be processed through `redactSensitiveData` with request length guards.
- Forecast/benchmark endpoints guard against missing families and return actionable error states for the UI.

## Conclusion

✅ **Both AI features are fully functional and tested**
✅ **PDF support successfully implemented using Claude's document API**
✅ **Production-ready with proper error handling**
✅ **Clean, user-friendly formatting**
✅ **Fast response times (2-4 seconds)**
✅ **Excellent instruction-following with Claude Sonnet 4**

**✅ READY FOR USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING!**
