# AI Features Test Results & Fixes

## FIXED Issues:

### 1. Receipt Scanner - PDF Support NOW ENABLED ✅
- **Problem**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental vision model does NOT support PDF files
- **Solution**: Switched to **Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct** model which DOES support PDFs
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Changed AI model from `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` to `qwen/qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct`
  - Re-enabled PDF support in file input (now accepts: JPG, PNG, WebP, PDF)
  - Updated UI text to reflect "Upload Image or PDF"
  - Added better error handling and validation
- **Cost**: $0.10 per 1M tokens (extremely cheap)
- **Status**: Ready for testing with both images AND PDFs

### 2. Budget Insights - Formatting Improved ✅
- **Problem**: AI response quality was poor and not aligned with data
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Added smart text formatting to remove markdown asterisks
  - Implemented bullet point rendering for list items
  - Added section header styling
  - Updated AI prompt to focus on savings opportunities instead of comparisons
- **Status**: Ready for re-testing

## Known Limitations:
- Receipt scanner now supports both images AND PDFs (using Qwen2-VL model)
- AI insights quality depends on OpenRouter API response
- Both features require OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- Qwen2-VL costs $0.10 per 1M tokens (very cheap for occasional use)
